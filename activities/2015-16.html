	<h2>ICI CET CHAPTER INAUGURATION</h2>
The activities of ICI CET Chapter for the academic year 2015-2016 commenced with an
inaugural meeting held on 17th August 2015, at CETAA hall. Dr. Mini Soman, coordinator
of ICI CET Chapter, welcomed the gathering. Presidential address was delivered by Dr. J
David, principal CET. The activities of the chapter for the academic year 2015-16 were
formally inaugurated by Architect G.Shankar, founder of Habitat Technology Group,
Thiruvananthapuram, by lighting the lamp and giving a talk on the topic “SUSTAINABLE
CONSTRUCTION”.
Ar. Shanker, renowned for the use of locally available materials, sustainability, ecofriendliness and cost effectiveness in the construction industry emphasized on the sustainable model of development through his talk. His works is proving to be a great inspiration in the emerging field of sustainable construction and he was able to provide live examples of successful works under his guidance. His ideology and design concepts are found to be a very effective alternative for present construction materials and a good solution for major environmental degradation due to concrete construction technology. Finally, he called upon all civil engineers to venture into the field of sustainable engineering and provide a viable solution to the fast degrading environmental conditions.Prof. Jairaj and Prof. Biju.V, faculty members of civil engineering department felicitated the function. Formal video release of PANTHEON 2015 was also held during the meeting. Nikhil.R.V, secretary, ICI CET Chapter rendered the vote of thanks. Over 200 attended the function.

<h2>TECHNICAL TALKS</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 50px">
<h3>1)INTRODUCTION TO REVIT AND STAAD</h3>

ICI CET Chapter organised an Introduction to Autodesk Revit on 12/8/2015 at 4.p.m in Seminar Hall 1, Civil Engineering Dept. The program was inaugurated by Dr. Mini. Soman, faculty-in-charge, ICI CET Chapter. The talk was conducted by InterCAD, a CADD software training institute. Mr. Shiyas Shafi, an official from InterCAD, gave an hour long introduction class and an onstage demonstration on Revit which was attended by over 40 students. He was accompanied by Mr. Vivek, another InterCAD official. Autodesk Revit is building information modelling software for architects, structural engineers, MEP engineers, designers and contractors. It allows users to design a building, structures and its components in 3D, annotate the model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the building model's database. A 20 hour programme which provides a platform for students to learn and get expertise was also planned to be conducted in the coming semester. In addition to Revit, InterCAD had also offered certified classes for STAAD and PRIMAVERA.

<h3>3)CIVIL SERVICES FOR ENGINEERING GRADUATES</h3>
SRI. D. HARIKRISHNAN<br>
OCTOBER 14, 2015<br>
Back 2 Department was a programme initiated by Dr. Mini Soman, ICI staff coordinator, to bring our seniors back to the campus for interactive sessions with the students on therir careers. The first of this programme was attended by Sri. D Harikrishnan, 2012 passout from the Civil Department who had cleared the civil services examinations for IRS. Apart from the technical stuff that the students attended till then, they were experiencing the real stories behind the success of engineering students. The attractive thing about the session was that there was no typical 9 pointer boy from the start in his story. Students were motivated when he said that the right moment will come to you and until then you should enjoy your youth life to the maximum. He was willing to clear everyone's doubt on the Civil Services Exams and what after that. He was accompanied by his old friend who also briefly interacted with us. The talk gave the students the strength to face the future with less doubt and more determination.
The session ended with Mini Soman Mam presenting a memento as our token of gratitude to Sri. Harikrishnan.

<h2>SPICE</h2>
S.P.I.C.E expanded as Special Program In Communicative English, is a continuous program aimed at developing the communication skills of the students. The program is conducted on a weekly basis. Spice was started under the vision of the former Head of the Department and ICI staff coordinator, Dr. Ruby Abraham under the leadership of Dr. Mini Soman and Dr. Jeenu G as staff coordinators and Haneena and Milan as the student coordinators. The
programs of Spice kick started with sessions by Prof Abhilash Daniel of the CET MBA department. The program became a grant success and the coordinators had to limit the number of students attending the weekly sessions. Due to its grant success, other organisations inside the college started similar programs for its student members.

<h2>PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>
A session on ‘How to face an Interview’ was conducted by Prof. Abhilash Daniel George, faculty of MBA department of the college. It was conducted from 12 to 2 pm on 29-01- 2016. This was the first programme conducted under S.P.I.C.E. The session was very useful for the students who are attending the campus placements in the college. The interactive session consisting of various activities and a lecture on how to attend interviews, was utilized by most of its members, who saw it as a chance to improve their communication skills. In the class, we were given a list of dos and donts in an Interview like don’t start with the phrase ‘Myself XYZ’, don’t get into details about siblings and cousins, don’t cite ‘making friends’ or ‘meeting new people’ as a hobby, don’t say things like “I studied this in my first year” as an excuse for not knowing more basic stuff related to their subject of study.

<h2>INDUSTRIAL VISITS</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 50px">
	
<h3>1)POABS M-SAND UNIT</h3>
ICI CET Chapter organized its first industrial visit for the academic year 2015-16 on 1st August 2015, Saturday to POABS M-Sand unit and Aruvikkara Water Treatment Plant. Over 30 student members from S5 and S3 batches attended the same. The group was accompanied by Prof. Biju.V, faculty, civil engineering department.
At POAB M-Sand unit, students were able to see how M-sand (Manufactured Sand) is being produced on a large scale unit. M-Sand is usually used where there is a shortage of river sand. POAB also produced p-sand (plasticized sand) which is exclusively used for plastering. Crushed rocks which are transferred through conveyor belts are sieved through large mechanical sieves of various sizes such as 40mm, 20mm, 4.75mm, 0.3mm, 0.15mm etc. The aggregates sized between 4.75mm and 0.15mm is used for M-sand production. Finer aggregates are removed by adding water. Sieved aggregates are made into cubes using vertical shaft impact. Aggregates sized between 3mm and 0.15mm is used for p-sand production, which is directly used for plastering.

<h2>ICI CET CHAPTER QUIZ</h2>
A technical quiz was conducted on 23rd July 2015, which was designed to test the technical knowledge and interest in the field of civil engineering. The event was open to all student members. The quiz was conducted in two stages. The preliminary stage was a written test, which was held on July 23rd, Wednesday. The test was based on basic civil engineering and constructions facts from around the globe. The test consisted of 20 questions for a duration of 20 minutes.
