ICI CET STUDENTS’ CHAPTER conducted a one-day camp in the village of Mariyanad as part of the Chapter's Social Service Wing Coordinated by Aminul Hassan and Faseeh. It provided an opportunity for the students in gaining practical skills and to be exposed to the rural areas. There were about 35 students belonging to second, third and fourth years from the Civil Department. The objective of the camp was to undertake some electrical, plumbing and civil works of the Government L P School in Maryanad village. The activities kick started at 9 am in the morning. The students were divided into 3 groups, with each group undertaking a specific work. The first group carried out the
plumbing work where students built a new washing area. The second group carried out the electrical works and the exhaust was attached to the kitchen. The third group took the initiative to build the compound wall in the school.Some of the students were engaged in cooking food for the students. Even  though with the limited facilities, they managed to prepare tasty and healthy food for breakfast and lunch.<br>
The students faced a lot of challenges but were able to overcome them
due to their hard work and dedication for the cause. The students can be proud for their contribution in nurturing the future hopes of the nation's foundation.We are extremely thankful to Prof.Biju Sir for his presence and guidance during the activity.
