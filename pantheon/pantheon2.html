<h2>1. THE BEST ENGINEER</h2>
The main competition and the title event was “The Best Engineer” which sought for the contestant to go through a series of drilling rounds testing the participant's IQ, ability to think on their feet, stress handling capabilities and depth of subject knowledge. The competition consisted of a total of five rounds. The preliminary round was written test which had multiple choice type questions. The second round was group discussion on a socially relevant topic. The next round was a practical round to test the practical skills of the participants. The fourth round was a situation management round in which every participant was given a situation to solve.
