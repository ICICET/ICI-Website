<h1>PANTHEON 3.0</h1>
Pantheon is a national level inter college technical fest, organized by the ICI studentâ€™s chapter of College of Engineering Trivandrum. The event is exclusively for civil engineering students from all over the country. The competition seeks talent, exhibiting potential to be titled the best, among the group of amateur civil engineers at the doorsteps of entering the professional world. This year we launched the third edition of Pantheon on 30th September 2016, with a whole new palette of events which lasted for two days. The fest took to a higher level this year, with a total of ten events and three workshops. It witnessed a wide participation, with over 650 students from across the nation.

<h2>EVENTS</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 50px">

<h3>1.Event-X</h3>
Event X, the main event of pantheon 3.0, was a technical event which tested the potential and talent of aspiring civil engineers. The event was conducted on September 30th. A total of 36 teams (around 140 students) from various engineering colleges in the state participated. 5 teams were shortlisted after the preliminary round, which consisted of objective and short answer type technical questions. In the second round, the teams completed a series of civil engineering tasks which comprised of rock specimen identification, specific gravity determination, anthropometry and a civil based crossword. In round three, a plot was surveyed using plane table and in round four, the teams designed a single storeyed house for the plot they surveyed. In round five, a scaled model of the planned building was made out of forex sheets. In round six, the teams were asked to market their plans and model in front of a panel of judges. The winners were found out based on the cumulative points from round two onwards. The first prize of Rs 20000 was won by the team lead by Manu K Soman from TKM College of Engineering.

<h3>2. Alphaminds</h3>
Alphaminds was an innovative paper presentation event. The competition was conducted on 30th September. The topic was given a week before Pantheon and the students were asked to send in abstracts. The topic given to the students were Latest innovations in Civil Engineering (with emphasis on their applications in India) or Case study of major Engineering Disasters in India.? Only the best twelve abstracts were selected to the next round. The competition saw different styles of presentation and all the students were well aware of the topic. After the
presentation there was a questioning round, where the judges asked the students from their presentation. Based on the presentation and the performance in the questioning round, the students were awarded. Dr. Jeenu G and Dr. Ajitha Bhaskar were the judges of the event. The first prize of Rs 6000 was won by Sheetal S J.

<h3>3. Cad Drawing</h3>
As part of PANTHEON 3.0, Cad drawing competition was conducted successfully on 30th September 2016.The competition was conducted in two stages, aptitude test and drawing. 62 teams wrote the aptitude test from which 15 teams were selected for the main drawing competition. The question was given by INTERCAD. The participants were asked to draw the plan of ground floor and 1st floor of a residential building along with the cross section. The winners of the event were decided by Prof. Biju V and Samuel D Sagar . The first prize of Rs 5000 was won
by Akhil K Nair and Ashik N from Mohandas CET Trivandrum.
â€ƒ
<h3>4. Best Engineer</h3>
Best Engineer is an event which has always been popular among the students, right from the first edition of Pantheon. It tests the technical knowledge of students in the civil engineering domain.The event turned out to be a huge success as expected with an overwhelming participation of 6o+ students. The judges of the event were Dr. K Girija, Dr. R Padmakumar, Dr. Bindhu K R and Prof Abhilash( MBA Dept). Nihal A Saleem of NIT Calicut became the best engineer and won Rs 12000.

<h3>5.Situation Management</h3>
Situation management was an event which tested the capability of the participant to handle the situation ahead of time which would demand technical skill as well as creativity. It was conducted on October 1st. The event consisted of three rounds. The first round was a general aptitude test which consisted of 25 questions and each team consisting of two participants were allotted 20 minutes time. Out of the 40 teams, who wrote the aptitude, 15 teams were shortlisted for the second round. In the second round, the teams were asked to analyze an image, video and a statement and were also asked to find a solution for each by relating each
problem to civil engineering field. The judges were Prof. Thulasidharan T and Dr. Ajith G. Nair. 5 teams were shortlisted to the next round. In the final round, the teams were asked to construct a building model based on certain situations such as wind direction, direction of north, available resources etc.

<h3>6. Creatrix</h3>
Creatrix is an event which tests the structural knowledge of students. The students had to use their intellects to create a model with limited resources and time frame to withstand the adverse load conditions. The event was conducted on 1st October 2016. It consisted of two rounds. There was a preliminary written test in which 27 teams participated. The top five teams were selected to the next round. The participants had to attempt the 20 technical questions in the test within 30 minutes. Since the event involved, testing of models the teams were called for
round two after specific intervals. Each team was given 150 ice cream sticks and 25 gm Glue to construct their model. The time limit to make the model was 100 minutes. Within the time frame, the participants had to build a 3D structure of minimum height 30 cm and base area 15cm X 15cm, and minimum top area 10cm X 10cm. The students were given a 10 minutes cool off time before the models were taken for testing. The models were tested in the blower type wind tunnel present in the Fluid Mechanics lab. The maximum wind speed was 18mps. The team which secured first place created a model which withstood a wind velocity of 17mps.

<h3>7. Build My City</h3>
It was for the first time in the history of college technical fests that a Town Planning Gaming event was conducted, for which SIMCITY, a well renowned virtual city building game, was utilised. The event received a huge acceptance among the contestants as they assured their utmost interest and participation, experiencing a new perspective of town planning event in their life as an engineering student. The Build My City team, could positively conduct the event in 2 batches on a day and so they could successfully conduct a total of 4 batches of the event in two days of
Pantheon 3.0. The event attracted a huge number of contestants, including students from other districts of Kerala and even from other states! The contestants of each batch were scheduled to build their own virtual cities in 120 minutes. Judgments were efficiently based on three basic criteria that the game gave out at each stage of the contestant  quest for building their owncities approval rating by the people in the built city, citys savings and citys population at the 120th minute. For each 120min batch, cash prizes of Rs.2000 and Rs.1000 were awarded for the first and second prize winners respectively. This gaming event saw a participation of fourteen teams in each batch, summing up a total of almost 150 individual registrations in the two dayevent.

<h3>8. Mix Design Workshop</h3>

They included a few who came via spot registration.
The class was engaged by two faculties from InterCAD. The students got the opportunity to familiarise with the leading structural analysis software. Classes comprised of two sessions.

<h3>10. Revit Workshop</h3>
The REVIT workshop was conducted at College of Engineering Trivandrum on October 1st and was handled by faculties from InterCAD. The co-ordination team was a team of eight members comprising of two coordinators from fourth year and six volunteers from second year.Lab facilities for the event were arranged by the team. Participants for the workshop were led to the Civil DCF and Architecture computer lab where the classes for Revit workshop were arranged.
There were a total of fifty one students. Twenty nine students were seated in the Architecture computer lab and twenty two in the Civil DCF. They included a few who came via spot registration as well. Each class was engaged by two of their faculties. The software they dealt was REVIT 2016. The students got the opportunity to familiarise with the leading 3-D design software.
